          <span class="image main"><img src="images/assss.png" alt="" /></span>
          <p>
            1. Several variables were declared for the following columns:
            @pid INT = 0;: This line declares a variable @pid as an integer type and initializes it to 0.
            @units INT = 0;: This line declares a variable @units as an integer type and initializes it to 0.
            @price MONEY = 0;: This line declares a variable @price as a money type (representing currency)
             and initializes it to 0.<br />
            2.  I create a loop using the construct. This construct creates an infinite loop since the condition 1=1 is always true<br />
            3. Inside the loop, random values are generated for @pid, @units, and @price.
            SET @pid = ROUND(RAND()*3, 0)+1;: Generates a random number between 1 and 3 (inclusive).
            SET @units = ROUND(RAND()*10, 0)+1;: Generates a random number between 1 and 10 (inclusive).
            Price calculation is based on the randomly generated @pid.
            If @pid is 1, price is calculated as 10.10 times @units.
            If @pid is 2, price is calculated as 6.00 times @units.
            If @pid is 3, price is calculated as 9.2 times @units.<br />
            4. INSERT INTO Project_Demo_Table VALUES (GETDATE(), @pid, @units, @price);: Inserts a new row into the Project_Demo_Table with the current date and time, along with the values of @pid, @units, and @price generated in the loop.
            <br />
            5. After the loop completes, another SELECT statement is used to display all
             data from the Project_Demo_Table. This will show the populated table with the simulated data.
            Tools and Technologies: MySQL, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib
              <br>
            6. The data was  loaded into Power BI to create visualizations such as charts, graphs, and tables based on the data from Project_Demo_Table. Power BI will automatically refresh the data according to your refresh settings,
             providing live visualization as new data is inserted into the table

        <p>
          - Developed an efficient fraud detection system that can identify and flag potentially fraudulent online payment transactions in real-time.<br>
          - The project begins by collecting a dataset containing historical online payment transaction records.<br>
          - Data preprocessing involves cleaning and transforming the data into a suitable format for machine learning.<br>
          - The Decision Tree Classifier is the central machine learning algorithm employed in this project. Decision trees are well-suited for fraud detection as they can model complex decision boundaries and are interpretable, making it easier to understand why a particular transaction is flagged as fraudulent.<br>
          - The algorithm learns from historical data, utilizing the various features to create a tree-like structure that can classify transactions as either legitimate or potentially fraudulent.<br>
          - Transactions flagged as potentially fraudulent trigger alerts or further investigation by the payment platform's security team.<br>
