          <h3>HR Analytics Dashboard Project Overview</h3>
          <span class="image main"><img src="images/alpha.png" alt="" /></span>
          <p>
            1. The data was initially loaded into Power BI and subsequently transferred to the Power Query environment, 
            where I transformed and cleaned the data.<br />
            2. Next, I transferred it
             back to the Power BI environment for additional analysis.<br />
            3. I constructed a dashboard enabling visualization of crucial 
            information such as Attrition count by education field and job satisfaction.<br />
            
            Tools and Technologies: Power BI

          <h3>Realtime-SQL-Demo-with-PowerBI-Dashboard: Project Overview</h3>
          <span class="image main"><img src="images/assss.png" alt="" /></span>
          <p>
            1. Several variables were declared for the following columns:
            @pid INT = 0;: This line declares a variable @pid as an integer type and initializes it to 0.
            @units INT = 0;: This line declares a variable @units as an integer type and initializes it to 0.
            @price MONEY = 0;: This line declares a variable @price as a money type (representing currency)
             and initializes it to 0.<br />
            2.  I create a loop using the construct. This construct creates an infinite loop since the condition 1=1 is always true<br />
            3. Inside the loop, random values are generated for @pid, @units, and @price.
            SET @pid = ROUND(RAND()*3, 0)+1;: Generates a random number between 1 and 3 (inclusive).
            SET @units = ROUND(RAND()*10, 0)+1;: Generates a random number between 1 and 10 (inclusive).
            Price calculation is based on the randomly generated @pid.
            If @pid is 1, price is calculated as 10.10 times @units.
            If @pid is 2, price is calculated as 6.00 times @units.
            If @pid is 3, price is calculated as 9.2 times @units.<br />
            4. INSERT INTO Project_Demo_Table VALUES (GETDATE(), @pid, @units, @price);: Inserts a new row into the Project_Demo_Table with the current date and time, along with the values of @pid, @units, and @price generated in the loop.
            <br />
            5. After the loop completes, another SELECT statement is used to display all
             data from the Project_Demo_Table. This will show the populated table with the simulated data.
            Tools and Technologies: MySQL, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib
              <br>
            6. The data was  loaded into Power BI to create visualizations such as charts, graphs, and tables based on the data from Project_Demo_Table. Power BI will automatically refresh the data according to your refresh settings,
             providing live visualization as new data is inserted into the table
